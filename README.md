I have developed a Stopwatch Web Application as part of my Web Development Internship at Prodigy Infotech.  This application allows users to:  Start the stopwatch  Pause the stopwatch  Reset the stopwatch   It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features an intuitive interface and real-time timer updates.
